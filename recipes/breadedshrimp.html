    <p>An easy breaded shrimp recipe. A wonderful appetizer for a family dinner.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 quart vegetable oil</strong></li>
        <li><strong>4 cups shrimp, peeled and deveined</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 large egg, beaten</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2 cups dry bread crumbs</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Working one at a time, dip shrimp into beaten egg, allowing any excess egg to drip back into the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat both sides. Place the breaded shrimp, unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with remaining shrimp.</li>
        <li>Lower breaded shrimp carefully into preheated oil in batches. Fry until crispy and golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining breaded shrimp.</li>
